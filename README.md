Those are some regularly used bat files.

You can just run them as administrator.

<<Index:>>

1. 22_h2.bat:
   Disables Hyper-V.

2. BSOD_fix.bat:
   Disables Vulnerable Driver Blocklist.


Disclaimer:

Use at your own risk!
Although those just disable some basic Defender options for Windows 10 and Windows 11 respectively they should be used responsively. 
Disabling such feature may lead to a more vulnerable operating software which in return can be infected more easily with malicious software. 

As such, I only recommend using those batch files if you're certain what you're doing and exactly know what those options are (described above).
Hence, use only at your own discretion.
I neither endorse nor advise making your device more "welcoming" for malware.

Contact me if anything's wrong with those files / they need to be updated.
